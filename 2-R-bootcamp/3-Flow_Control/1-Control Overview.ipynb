    "R's flow control, also known as control flow,  dictates the order in which code is executed. It allows you to make your code more flexible and responsive to different conditions within your data or analysis. In order to control the execution of the expressions flow in R, we make use of the control structures. These control structures are also called as loops in R. There are eight types of control structures in R:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. if\n",
    "1. if-else\n",
    "1. for\n",
    "1. nested loops\n",
    "1. while\n",
    "1. repeat and break\n",
    "1. next\n",
    "1. return\n",
    "\n",
    "Control structures in R are used to control the flow of execution in a program. They allow you to make decisions, repeat code, and perform different actions based on certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above control structures can be classify thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conditional Statements**: Conditional statements allow you to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. The most commonly used conditional statements in R are `if`, `else if`, and `else`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loops**: Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. R provides different types of loops, including `for` loops, `while` loops, and `repeat` loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Switch Statements**: Switch statements are used to select one of several alternatives based on the value of an expression. They are similar to `if` statements but provide a more concise way to handle multiple conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Control Flow Statements**: Control flow statements allow you to control the flow of execution within a loop or a function. Examples of control flow statements in R include `break`, `next`, and `return`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These control structures provide flexibility and allow you to write more complex and dynamic programs in R. R provides various standard control structures for our requirements. The expr expression consists of multiple statements that can be enclosed in braces `{}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is more efficient to use built-in functions in R rather than control structures, whenever possible. This facilitates the flow of execution to be controlled inside a function. Control structures define the flow of the program. The decision is then made after the variable is assessed. \n",
